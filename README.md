# Claim-vs.-Opinion-Classification Using NLP
Using Natural Language Processing to detect if a statement is fact or opinion

In this project, I built a natural language processing pipeline to distinguish between factual claims and personal opinions in user-generated text, such as TikTok comments and social media posts. Using `CountVectorizer` and a logistic regression model, I achieved high accuracy through careful text preprocessing and feature engineering. This work reflects my strong grasp of text classification techniques and my passion for using AI to better understand consumer voice and behavior â€” a crucial skill in growth marketing and customer research.
