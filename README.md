# 🧠 Claim vs. Opinion Classifier Using Natural Language Processing (100% Accuracy)
This project demonstrates a clean and effective pipeline for classifying short text snippets into claims or opinions. Despite its simplicity, the task reflects a key application in content moderation, journalism, and social media monitoring.

💬 Goal: Distinguish factual claims from subjective opinions.

🧹 Preprocessing: Basic NLP cleaning (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal).

🧠 Model: Logistic Regression + CountVectorizer

🔁 Validation: 5-fold cross-validation, achieving 100% accuracy, indicating the dataset is clear and well-structured for this task.

📌 Skills Highlighted: Text cleaning, vectorization, binary classification, pipeline structuring, and model evaluation.

While basic, this project was intentionally designed to reflect foundational NLP principles in action. It serves as a building block for more complex tasks like emotion detection, fake news detection, or sentiment analysis
